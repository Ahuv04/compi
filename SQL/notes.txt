General syntax:

1. SELECT 
select column1, column2
from table;

2. select distinct
- for distinct values

3. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
- for counting


nice example:
SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);

-> DistinctCountries is the name when count comes
-> select count(of all) from given select query
